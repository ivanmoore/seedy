# Compile and build in Docker

So you don't need anything other than docker installed on your machine.

To compile only:

```
./build.sh
```

To compile and run:

```
./run.sh
```

# Compile on your machine

Executes more quickly - but you need haskell and stack installed on your machine.

Run `stack install`. It creates an executable: `~/.local/bin/seedy-exe`.
